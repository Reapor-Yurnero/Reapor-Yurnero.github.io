  introduction: [
    'I\'m a PhD candidate at [MESL](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/) of UCSD CSE, advised by [Rajesh K. Gupta](http://mesl.ucsd.edu/gupta/) and [Earlence Fernandes](http://www.earlence.com/). I obtained my bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiaotong University Joint Institute ([UM-SJTU JI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/)).',
    'My research interest spans widely, including CPS-IoT (smart buildings in particular), security, privacy, and applied cryptography. I missioned myself to help the general public embrace the utility and productivity of evolving technologies such as AI, smart hardware, etc. **without** being worried about various security, privacy, and safety issues including but not limited to ubiquitous surveillance, personal info leakage, and data misusage.
