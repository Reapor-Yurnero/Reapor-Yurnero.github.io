However, safety and security concerns and usability challenges have prohibited the wide adoption of AI-powered smart \"things\" in large-scale real-world systems. My research aims to close this gap by enabling secure and safe interaction with Cyber-Physical Systems in a user-friendly manner. Smart commercial buildings, typical examples of CPS with numerous, multi-tenant, distributed, and interconnected IoT devices, are my main testbed.","type":"research"}}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1695f7c1de984950c59d7ecf81fd70dd/3ea76/logo.png","srcSet":"/static/1695f7c1de984950c59d7ecf81fd70dd/3ea76/logo.png 320w,\n/static/1695f7c1de984950c59d7ecf81fd70dd/a4b87/logo.png 608w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1695f7c1de984950c59d7ecf81fd70dd/4a8d5/logo.webp 320w,\n/static/1695f7c1de984950c59d7ecf81fd70dd/5e659/logo.webp 608w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":180}}}},"fields":{"slug":{"links":[{"name":"code","url":"https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/059879e14301660c9fce1e5e59bdfaef89fc4aaf"},{"name":"slide","url":"/files/5e18d5ab06457cd3edad48cf6db84d4b/final_pre.pptx"},{"name":"report","url":"/files/ad5e3bbbdb2e7f4dbb5dc19c121e89a9/cse291_project_final_report.pdf"}],"date":"Jan 2020 - June 2020","venue":"","authors":[],"path":"research/gvisor_optimization","title":"Improving gVisor Memory Subsystem Performance","tags":["Operating System","Virtualization","Open Source Contribution"],"excerpt":"In this project, we analyzed the performance of the gVisor memory management subsystem, starting from benchmarking malloc and ending up focusing on MMAP.
