With this interface, developers can create applications so that building managers can use these applications to facilitate their work and residents can control their surrounding climate, electrical appliances smartly and conveniently. On top of [Brick Schema](https://brickschema.org/), we are building such a fully functional BOS composed of timeseries database, brick database, authorization, and so on, which is called Brick Server and its extended version Playground.\n\nBrick Server / Playground is\n\n- a minimal but fully functional Building Operating System (BOS),\n- an interface for Brick applications,\n- an emulator of a building for Brick applications development,\n- a demonstration of general methods to integrate your system with Brick, and\n- a testbed for new functions in Brick.\n\n\n## Ongoing Work\n\nAlthough this project is in the context of Smart Building, many problems that span across a wide range of areas are of our particular interest. \n1. How to do authorization and authentication properly in this complex multi-layer privilege model? (OS)\n2. How to scale well to fit e.g. a campus, tens of buildings, 10k data points, thousands of users? (Distributed System)\n3. How to guarantee the security and privacy of these sensitive data? (Security, Privacy and Cryptography)\n4. How to facilitate our platform to help control and monitor the risk of COVID19 spread caused by indoor gatherings? (Smart Building) See our [BuildSys20 Poster](buildsys20postersdemos-final8.pdf) for more details.\n\n\n","htmlEncrypted":"","nonce":"","timeToRead":null,"title":"Brick & Building Operating System","date":"Oct 2019 - Present","tags":["Smart Building","Operating System"],"path":"research/brick_bos","excerpt":"In this project, we are aiming to create a Building Operating System (BOS) providing an interface between the underlying building hardware (e.g. HVAC system, light, sensor) and users (e.g. developers, building managers, residents).
