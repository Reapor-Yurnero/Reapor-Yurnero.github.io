These new capabilities bring new benefits and also new security risks. In this work, we show that an attacker can use visual adversarial examples to cause attacker-desired tool usage. For example, the attacker could cause a victim LLM to delete calendar events, leak private conversations and book hotels. Different from prior work, our attacks can affect the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to the LLM while being stealthy and generalizable to multiple input prompts. We construct these attacks using gradient-based adversarial training and characterize performance along multiple dimensions. We find that our adversarial images can manipulate the LLM to invoke tools following real-world syntax almost always (~98%) while maintaining high similarity to clean images (~0.9 SSIM). Furthermore, using human scoring and automated metrics, we find that the attacks do not noticeably affect the conversation (and its semantics) between the user and the LLM.","priority":0,"links":[{"name":"Paper(Arxiv)","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03185"}]}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/Reapor-Yurnero.github.io/Reapor-Yurnero.github.io/content/research/llm_security/index.md"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/3ea76/preview.png","srcSet":"/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/3ea76/preview.png 320w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/2c755/preview.png 750w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/1ec6c/preview.png 1080w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/78ee8/preview.png 1366w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/af64f/preview.png 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/4a8d5/preview.webp 320w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/a36ff/preview.webp 750w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/afc13/preview.webp 1080w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/43d67/preview.webp 1366w,\n/static/fe35423bb8fd08c9d7e8305e2be9e831/f60c5/preview.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":180}}}},"fields":{"slug":{"date":"Jun 2023 - Present","venue":"","authors":["Collaborated with Xiyuan Zhang, and others"],"path":"research/pilot","title":"Physics-Informed Data Denoising for Real-Life Sensing Systems","tags":["Sensing","Physics-informed"],"excerpt":"Sensors measuring real-life physical processes are ubiquitous in todayâ€™s interconnected world. These sensors inherently bear noise that often adversely affects performance and reliability of the systems they support. Classic filtering-based approaches introduce strong assumptions on the time or frequency characteristics of sensory measurements, while learning-based denoising approaches typically rely on using ground truth clean data to train a denoising model, which is often challenging or prohibitive to obtain for many real-world applications. We observe that in many scenarios, the relationships between different sensor measurements (e.g., location and acceleration) are analytically described by laws of physics (e.g., second-order differential equation). By incorporating such physics constraints, we can guide the denoising process to improve even in the absence of ground truth data. In light of this, we design a physics-informed denoising model that leverages the inherent algebraic relationships between different measurements governed by the underlying physics. By obviating the need for ground truth clean data, our method offers a practical denoising solution for realworld applications. We conducted experiments in various domains, including inertial navigation, CO2 monitoring, and HVAC control, and achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with existing denoising methods. Our method can denoise data in real time (4ms for a sequence of 1s) for low-cost noisy sensors and produces results that closely align with those from high-precision, high-cost alternatives, leading to an efficient, cost-effective approach for more accurate sensor-based systems.","priority":0,"links":[{"name":"Sensys23 Paper","url":"https://xiyuanzh.github.io/assets/publications/PILOT.pdf"}]}},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/Reapor-Yurnero.github.io/Reapor-Yurnero.github.io/content/research/denoising/index.md"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/8998d/preview.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/8998d/preview.jpg 320w,\n/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/a9545/preview.jpg 750w,\n/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/850d6/preview.jpg 760w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/4a8d5/preview.webp 320w,\n/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/a36ff/preview.webp 750w,\n/static/ba316fe93c18cc57602dff533ac09709/0f647/preview.webp 760w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":180}}}},"fields":{"slug":{"date":"Jun 2020 - Present","venue":"","authors":["With Rahul Chatterjee, Varun Chandrasekaran"],"path":"research/mf_auth","title":"Context-Aware, Continuous Authentication Using Biometrics & Fuzzy Extractors","tags":["Security & Privacy","Cryptography"],"excerpt":"In our work, we deviate from the status quo and show how users can authenticate themselves using biometrics whilst.
