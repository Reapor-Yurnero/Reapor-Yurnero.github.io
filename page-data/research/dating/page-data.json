However, this may cause embarrassment, perhaps even leading to an\nend of a friendship or difficulty in collaborating. For this reason, people are often shy about speaking out\ntheir interest in another person. However, at the same time, not being able to confess an interest would\nalso be unfortunate when two people are coincidentally mutually interested. To avoid this, we aim to\nsolve the problem at its source, which is to prevent the potential for embarrassment while still\nregistering the interest, maintaining the security and privacy of the source party.\n\nIn addition, we want to keep all the \"relationships\" private even to the service provider.\n\n## Note\n\nI came up with this project idea in my senior year at UM-SJTU JI and took it as my capstone design project. The scheme we came up was preliminary. I tried to continue this project after joining UCSD and talked to Mihir, Deian and Daniele. Based on the conversations, I presented an improved version at the 2019 CSE Research Open House poster session to collect more feedbacks. Currently, this project is suspended for lack of cycles. But I'm still interested in this problem and will devote more time to it if there's a chance.\n\n## Future Work\n\nSome thoughts about future directions:\n1. Give a formal cryptography definition (probably game-based) on \"security\" and \"privacy\" in this context.\n2. Give a scalable protocol which satisfies the above definition.\n3. Connect to contact-tracing problem and homomorphic encryption.","htmlEncrypted":"","nonce":"","timeToRead":null,"title":"Secure and Private 'Dating' System","date":"May 2019 - June 2020 (Suspended)","tags":["Cryptography","Security and Privacy"],"path":"research/dating","excerpt":"Dating applications are widely adopted all over the world.
